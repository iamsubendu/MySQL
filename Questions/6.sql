-- Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, 
-- finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.

-- Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the 
-- minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand 
-- of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, 
-- and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of 
-- descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result 
-- in order of descending age.

-- Input Format

-- The following tables contain data on the wands in Ollivander's inventory:

-- Wands: The id is the id of the wand, code is the code of the wand, 
-- coins_needed is the total number of gold galleons needed to buy the wand, 
-- and power denotes the quality of the wand (the higher the power, the 
-- better the wand is).

-- Wands_Property: The code is the code of the wand, age is the age of the wand, 
-- and is_evil denotes whether the wand is good for the dark arts. If the value 
-- of is_evil is 0, it means that the wand is not evil. The mapping between code 
-- and age is one-one, meaning that if there are two pairs,  and , then  and .
